     <p> The members of NGOs identify the problems in the society and their resources try to resolve them by performing the above-mentioned functions. The members of NGOs work with the objective of charitable motive only, there is no self-interest involved, as the main aim of NGOs in India is to serve the poor people and the people who are suffering from natural calamities. However, these organizations have to comply with the rules and regulations as are framed by the government of India.      </p><br>

   <p>Even today, though, unrestrained economic inequality exists, and individuals struggle to obtain basic necessities such as health, food, clothing, housing, and education. This is when the non-governmental organization (NGO) steps in to assist and serve. They do their job by filling in the blanks.    </p><br>

 <p>The NGO has a major role and is the biggest reason for the deprived people’s development in society. It is also performing a commendable job in this direction. It has assumed various projects like eradication of poverty and is working upon numerous social evils. It has contributed to the construction of dams, railways, and roads and has made the availability of all the basic facilities to the underprivileged, rustic areas, and vulnerable sections of society. The function of an NGO is to set an example for serving humanity. It is following the fundamental principle of “Sarvajan history – Sarvajan Sukhey” and therefore has a long way to go in nation-building.
